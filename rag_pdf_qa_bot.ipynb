As\\nwe pre-train larger models, full ﬁne-tuning, which retrains all model parameters,\\nbecomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example – deploying indepen-\\ndent instances of ﬁne-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively\\nexpensive. We propose Low-RankAdaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-\\ntrained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each\\nlayer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable pa-\\nrameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B ﬁne-tuned with Adam,\\nLoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the\\nGPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than ﬁne-\\ntuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite hav-\\ning fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters,\\nno additional inference latency . We also provide an empirical investigation into\\nrank-deﬁciency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efﬁcacy of\\nLoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch\\nmodels and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa,\\nDeBERTa, and GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA .\\n1 I NTRODUCTION\\nPretrained \\nWeights\\n𝑊∈ℝ𝑑×𝑑\\nxh\\n𝐵=0\\n𝐴=𝒩(0,𝜎2)\\n𝑑𝑟Pretrained \\nWeights\\n𝑊∈ℝ𝑑×𝑑\\nxf(x)\\n𝑑\\nFigure 1: Our reparametriza-\\ntion.

More importantly, these method often fail to\\nmatch the ﬁne-tuning baselines, posing a trade-off between efﬁciency and model quality.\\nWe take inspiration from Li et al. (2018a); Aghajanyan et al. (2020) which show that the learned\\nover-parametrized models in fact reside on a low intrinsic dimension. We hypothesize that the\\nchange in weights during model adaptation also has a low “intrinsic rank”, leading to our proposed\\nLow-RankAdaptation (LoRA) approach. LoRA allows us to train some dense layers in a neural\\nnetwork indirectly by optimizing rank decomposition matrices of the dense layers’ change during\\nadaptation instead, while keeping the pre-trained weights frozen, as shown in Figure 1. Using GPT-3\\n175B as an example, we show that a very low rank (i.e., rin Figure 1 can be one or two) sufﬁces even\\nwhen the full rank (i.e., d) is as high as 12,288, making LoRA both storage- and compute-efﬁcient.\\nLoRA possesses several key advantages.\\n• A pre-trained model can be shared and used to build many small LoRA modules for dif-\\nferent tasks. We can freeze the shared model and efﬁciently switch tasks by replacing the\\nmatricesAandBin Figure 1, reducing the storage requirement and task-switching over-\\nhead signiﬁcantly.\\n• LoRA makes training more efﬁcient and lowers the hardware barrier to entry by up to 3\\ntimes when using adaptive optimizers since we do not need to calculate the gradients or\\nmaintain the optimizer states for most parameters. Instead, we only optimize the injected,\\nmuch smaller low-rank matrices.\\n• Our simple linear design allows us to merge the trainable matrices with the frozen weights\\nwhen deployed, introducing no inference latency compared to a fully ﬁne-tuned model, by\\nconstruction.\\n• LoRA is orthogonal to many prior methods and can be combined with many of them, such\\nas preﬁx-tuning. We provide an example in Appendix E.\\nTerminologies and Conventions We make frequent references to the Transformer architecture\\nand use the conventional terminologies for its dimensions. We call the input and output di-\\nmension size of a Transformer layer dmodel . We useWq,Wk,Wv, andWoto refer to the\\nquery/key/value/output projection matrices in the self-attention module. WorW0refers to a pre-\\ntrained weight matrix and ∆Wits accumulated gradient update during adaptation. We use rto\\ndenote the rank of a LoRA module. We follow the conventions set out by (Vaswani et al., 2017;\\nBrown et al., 2020) and use Adam (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019; Kingma & Ba, 2017) for model\\noptimization and use a Transformer MLP feedforward dimension dffn= 4×dmodel .\\n2 P ROBLEM STATEMENT\\nWhile our proposal is agnostic to training objective, we focus on language modeling as our motivat-\\ning use case. Below is a brief description of the language modeling problem and, in particular, the\\nmaximization of conditional probabilities given a task-speciﬁc prompt.\\nSuppose we are given a pre-trained autoregressive language model PΦ(y|x)parametrized by Φ.\\nFor instance, PΦ(y|x)can be a generic multi-task learner such as GPT (Radford et al., b; Brown\\net al., 2020) based on the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017). Consider adapting this\\npre-trained model to downstream conditional text generation tasks, such as summarization, machine\\nreading comprehension (MRC), and natural language to SQL (NL2SQL). Each downstream task is\\nrepresented by a training dataset of context-target pairs: Z={(xi,yi)}i=1,..,N, where both xiand\\nyiare sequences of tokens. For example, in NL2SQL, xiis a natural language query and yiits\\ncorresponding SQL command; for summarization, xiis the content of an article and yiits summary.\\n2'),\n",

Thus, if the pre-trained model is large\\n(such as GPT-3 with |Φ0|≈175Billion), storing and deploying many independent instances of\\nﬁne-tuned models can be challenging, if at all feasible.\\nIn this paper, we adopt a more parameter-efﬁcient approach, where the task-speciﬁc parameter\\nincrement ∆Φ = ∆Φ(Θ) is further encoded by a much smaller-sized set of parameters Θwith\\n|Θ|≪| Φ0|.

When the pre-trained model is GPT-3 175B, the number of train-\\nable parameters|Θ|can be as small as 0.01% of|Φ0|.\\n3 A REN’TEXISTING SOLUTIONS GOOD ENOUGH ?\\nThe problem we set out to tackle is by no means new. Since the inception of transfer learning, dozens\\nof works have sought to make model adaptation more parameter- and compute-efﬁcient. See Sec-\\ntion 6 for a survey of some of the well-known works. Using language modeling as an example, there\\nare two prominent strategies when it comes to efﬁcient adaptations: adding adapter layers (Houlsby\\net al., 2019; Rebufﬁ et al., 2017; Pfeiffer et al., 2021; R ¨uckl´e et al., 2020) or optimizing some forms\\nof the input layer activations (Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Hambardzumyan et al., 2020;\\nLiu et al., 2021). However, both strategies have their limitations, especially in a large-scale and\\nlatency-sensitive production scenario.\\nAdapter Layers Introduce Inference Latency There are many variants of adapters. We focus\\non the original design by Houlsby et al. (2019) which has two adapter layers per Transformer block\\nand a more recent one by Lin et al. (2020) which has only one per block but with an additional\\nLayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016). While one can reduce the overall latency by pruning layers or exploit-\\ning multi-task settings (R ¨uckl´e et al., 2020; Pfeiffer et al., 2021), there is no direct ways to bypass\\nthe extra compute in adapter layers. This seems like a non-issue since adapter layers are designed\\nto have few parameters (sometimes <1% of the original model) by having a small bottleneck di-\\nmension, which limits the FLOPs they can add. However, large neural networks rely on hardware\\nparallelism to keep the latency low, and adapter layers have to be processed sequentially. This makes\\na difference in the online inference setting where the batch size is typically as small as one. In a\\ngeneric scenario without model parallelism, such as running inference on GPT-2 (Radford et al., b)\\nmedium on a single GPU, we see a noticeable increase in latency when using adapters, even with a\\nvery small bottleneck dimension (Table 1).\\nThis problem gets worse when we need to shard the model as done in Shoeybi et al. (2020); Lep-\\nikhin et al. (2020), because the additional depth requires more synchronous GPU operations such as\\nAllReduce andBroadcast , unless we store the adapter parameters redundantly many times.\\nDirectly Optimizing the Prompt is Hard The other direction, as exempliﬁed by preﬁx tuning (Li\\n& Liang, 2021), faces a different challenge. We observe that preﬁx tuning is difﬁcult to optimize\\nand that its performance changes non-monotonically in trainable parameters, conﬁrming similar\\nobservations in the original paper. More fundamentally, reserving a part of the sequence length for\\nadaptation necessarily reduces the sequence length available to process a downstream task, which\\nwe suspect makes tuning the prompt less performant compared to other methods. We defer the study\\non task performance to Section 5.\\n3'),\n",

The principles outlined here apply\\nto any dense layers in deep learning models, though we only focus on certain weights in Transformer\\nlanguage models in our experiments as the motivating use case.\\n4.1 L OW-RANK -PARAMETRIZED UPDATE MATRICES\\nA neural network contains many dense layers which perform matrix multiplication. The weight\\nmatrices in these layers typically have full-rank. When adapting to a speciﬁc task, Aghajanyan et al.\\n(2020) shows that the pre-trained language models have a low “instrisic dimension” and can still\\nlearn efﬁciently despite a random projection to a smaller subspace. Inspired by this, we hypothe-\\nsize the updates to the weights also have a low “intrinsic rank” during adaptation. For a pre-trained\\nweight matrix W0∈Rd×k, we constrain its update by representing the latter with a low-rank de-\\ncomposition W0+ ∆W=W0+BA, whereB∈Rd×r,A∈Rr×k, and the rank r≪min(d,k).\\nDuring training, W0is frozen and does not receive gradient updates, while AandBcontain trainable\\nparameters. Note both W0and∆W=BAare multiplied with the same input, and their respective\\noutput vectors are summed coordinate-wise. For h=W0x, our modiﬁed forward pass yields:\\nh=W0x+ ∆Wx=W0x+BAx (3)\\nWe illustrate our reparametrization in Figure 1. We use a random Gaussian initialization for Aand\\nzero forB, so∆W=BAis zero at the beginning of training. We then scale ∆Wx byα\\nr, whereα\\nis a constant in r. When optimizing with Adam, tuning αis roughly the same as tuning the learning\\nrate if we scale the initialization appropriately. As a result, we simply set αto the ﬁrstrwe try\\nand do not tune it. This scaling helps to reduce the need to retune hyperparameters when we vary\\nr(Yang & Hu, 2021).\\nA Generalization of Full Fine-tuning. A more general form of ﬁne-tuning allows the training of\\na subset of the pre-trained parameters. LoRA takes a step further and does not require the accumu-\\nlated gradient update to weight matrices to have full-rank during adaptation. This means that when\\napplying LoRA to all weight matrices and training all biases2, we roughly recover the expressive-\\nness of full ﬁne-tuning by setting the LoRA rank rto the rank of the pre-trained weight matrices. In\\nother words, as we increase the number of trainable parameters3, training LoRA roughly converges\\nto training the original model, while adapter-based methods converges to an MLP and preﬁx-based\\nmethods to a model that cannot take long input sequences.\\nNo Additional Inference Latency. When deployed in production, we can explicitly compute and\\nstoreW=W0+BA and perform inference as usual. Note that both W0andBA are inRd×k.\\nWhen we need to switch to another downstream task, we can recover W0by subtracting BAand\\nthen adding a different B′A′, a quick operation with very little memory overhead.

In the Transformer architecture, there are four weight matrices in\\nthe self-attention module ( Wq,Wk,Wv,Wo) and two in the MLP module. We treat Wq(orWk,Wv)\\nas a single matrix of dimension dmodel×dmodel , even though the output dimension is usually sliced\\ninto attention heads. We limit our study to only adapting the attention weights for downstream\\ntasks and freeze the MLP modules (so they are not trained in downstream tasks) both for simplicity\\nand parameter-efﬁciency.We further study the effect on adapting different types of attention weight\\nmatrices in a Transformer in Section 7.1. We leave the empirical investigation of adapting the MLP\\nlayers, LayerNorm layers, and biases to a future work.\\nPractical Beneﬁts and Limitations. The most signiﬁcant beneﬁt comes from the reduction in\\nmemory and storage usage. For a large Transformer trained with Adam, we reduce that VRAM\\nusage by up to 2/3ifr≪dmodel as we do not need to store the optimizer states for the frozen\\nparameters. On GPT-3 175B, we reduce the VRAM consumption during training from 1.2TB to\\n350GB. With r= 4and only the query and value projection matrices being adapted, the checkpoint\\nsize is reduced by roughly 10,000 ×(from 350GB to 35MB)4. This allows us to train with signiﬁ-\\ncantly fewer GPUs and avoid I/O bottlenecks. Another beneﬁt is that we can switch between tasks\\nwhile deployed at a much lower cost by only swapping the LoRA weights as opposed to all the\\nparameters. This allows for the creation of many customized models that can be swapped in and out\\non the ﬂy on machines that store the pre-trained weights in VRAM. We also observe a 25% speedup\\nduring training on GPT-3 175B compared to full ﬁne-tuning5as we do not need to calculate the\\ngradient for the vast majority of the parameters.\\nLoRA also has its limitations. For example, it is not straightforward to batch inputs to different tasks\\nwith different AandBin a single forward pass, if one chooses to absorb AandBintoWto eliminate\\nadditional inference latency. Though it is possible to not merge the weights and dynamically choose\\nthe LoRA modules to use for samples in a batch for scenarios where latency is not critical.\\n5 E MPIRICAL EXPERIMENTS\\nWe evaluate the downstream task performance of LoRA on RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), De-\\nBERTa (He et al., 2021), and GPT-2 (Radford et al., b), before scaling up to GPT-3 175B (Brown\\net al., 2020). Our experiments cover a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding\\n(NLU) to generation (NLG). Speciﬁcally, we evaluate on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2019) benchmark\\nfor RoBERTa and DeBERTa. We follow the setup of Li & Liang (2021) on GPT-2 for a direct com-\\nparison and add WikiSQL (Zhong et al., 2017) (NL to SQL queries) and SAMSum (Gliwa et al.,\\n2019) (conversation summarization) for large-scale experiments on GPT-3. See Appendix C for\\nmore details on the datasets we use. We use NVIDIA Tesla V100 for all experiments.\\n5.1 B ASELINES\\nTo compare with other baselines broadly, we replicate the setups used by prior work and reuse their\\nreported numbers whenever possible. This, however, means that some baselines might only appear\\nin certain experiments.\\nFine-Tuning (FT) is a common approach for adaptation. During ﬁne-tuning, the model is initialized\\nto the pre-trained weights and biases, and all model parameters undergo gradient updates.A simple\\nvariant is to update only some layers while freezing others. We include one such baseline reported\\nin prior work (Li & Liang, 2021) on GPT-2, which adapts just the last two layers ( FTTop2).\\n4We still need the 350GB model during deployment; however, storing 100 adapted models only requires\\n350GB + 35MB * 100 ≈354GB as opposed to 100 * 350GB ≈35TB.\\n5For GPT-3 175B, the training throughput for full ﬁne-tuning is 32.5 tokens/s per V100 GPU; with the same\\nnumber of weight shards for model parallelism, the throughput is 43.1 tokens/s per V100 GPU for LoRA.\\n5'),\n",

These spe-\\ncial tokens have trainable word embeddings and are generally not in the model’s vocabulary. Where\\nto place such tokens can have an impact on performance.

Training larger Transformers generally results in better performance and\\nremains an active research direction. GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) is the largest single Transformer\\nlanguage model trained to-date with 175B parameters.\\nPrompt Engineering and Fine-Tuning. While GPT-3 175B can adapt its behavior with just a\\nfew additional training examples, the result depends heavily on the input prompt (Brown et al.,\\n2020). This necessitates an empirical art of composing and formatting the prompt to maximize a\\nmodel’s performance on a desired task, which is known as prompt engineering or prompt hacking.\\nFine-tuning retrains a model pre-trained on general domains to a speciﬁc task Devlin et al.

However, the enormity of GPT-3 175B makes it challenging to perform ﬁne-tuning in\\nthe usual way due to the large checkpoint it produces and the high hardware barrier to entry since it\\nhas the same memory footprint as pre-training.\\nParameter-Efﬁcient Adaptation. Many have proposed inserting adapter layers between existing\\nlayers in a neural network (Houlsby et al., 2019; Rebufﬁ et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2020). Our method\\nuses a similar bottleneck structure to impose a low-rank constraint on the weight updates. The\\nkey functional difference is that our learned weights can be merged with the main weights during\\ninference, thus not introducing any latency, which is not the case for the adapter layers (Section 3).\\nA comtenporary extension of adapter is COMPACTER (Mahabadi et al., 2021), which essentially\\nparametrizes the adapter layers using Kronecker products with some predetermined weight sharing\\nscheme. Similarly, combining LoRA with other tensor product-based methods could potentially\\nimprove its parameter efﬁciency, which we leave to future work. More recently, many proposed\\noptimizing the input word embeddings in lieu of ﬁne-tuning, akin to a continuous and differentiable\\ngeneralization of prompt engineering (Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Hambardzumyan et al.,\\n2020; Liu et al., 2021).

Low-rank structure is very common in machine learn-\\ning. A lot of machine learning problems have certain intrinsic low-rank structure (Li et al., 2016;\\nCai et al., 2010; Li et al., 2018b; Grasedyck et al., 2013). Moreover, it is known that for many\\ndeep learning tasks, especially those with a heavily over-parametrized neural network, the learned\\nneural network will enjoy low-rank properties after training (Oymak et al., 2019). Some prior works\\neven explicitly impose the low-rank constraint when training the original neural network (Sainath\\net al., 2013; Povey et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2014; Jaderberg et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2016; Kho-\\ndak et al., 2021; Denil et al., 2014); however, to the best of our knowledge, none of these works\\nconsiders low-rank update to a frozen model for adaptation to downstream tasks . In theory liter-\\nature, it is known that neural networks outperform other classical learning methods, including the\\ncorresponding (ﬁnite-width) neural tangent kernels (Allen-Zhu et al., 2019; Li & Liang, 2018) when\\nthe underlying concept class has certain low-rank structure (Ghorbani et al., 2020; Allen-Zhu & Li,\\n2019; Allen-Zhu & Li, 2020a). Another theoretical result in Allen-Zhu & Li (2020b) suggests that\\nlow-rank adaptations can be useful for adversarial training. In sum, we believe that our proposed\\nlow-rank adaptation update is well-motivated by the literature.\\n7 U NDERSTANDING THE LOW-RANK UPDATES\\nGiven the empirical advantage of LoRA, we hope to further explain the properties of the low-rank\\nadaptation learned from downstream tasks. Note that the low-rank structure not only lowers the\\nhardware barrier to entry which allows us to run multiple experiments in parallel, but also gives\\nbetter interpretability of how the update weights are correlated with the pre-trained weights. We\\nfocus our study on GPT-3 175B, where we achieved the largest reduction of trainable parameters\\n(up to 10,000×) without adversely affecting task performances.\\nWe perform a sequence of empirical studies to answer the following questions: 1) Given a parameter\\nbudget constraint, which subset of weight matrices in a pre-trained Transformer should we adapt\\n9'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/lora.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content='to maximize downstream performance? 2) Is the “optimal” adaptation matrix ∆Wreally rank-\\ndeﬁcient ? If so, what is a good rank to use in practice? 3) What is the connection between ∆Wand\\nW? Does ∆Whighly correlate with W? How large is ∆Wcomparing to W?\\nWe believe that our answers to question (2) and (3) shed light on the fundamental principles of using\\npre-trained language models for downstream tasks, which is a critical topic in NLP.\\n7.1 W HICH WEIGHT MATRICES IN TRANSFORMER SHOULD WEAPPLY LORA TO?\\nGiven a limited parameter budget, which types of weights should we adapt with LoRA to obtain\\nthe best performance on downstream tasks? As mentioned in Section 4.2, we only consider weight\\nmatrices in the self-attention module. We set a parameter budget of 18M (roughly 35MB if stored\\nin FP16) on GPT-3 175B, which corresponds to r= 8if we adapt one type of attention weights or\\nr= 4if we adapt two types, for all 96 layers. The result is presented in Table 5.\\n# of Trainable Parameters = 18M\\nWeight Type WqWkWvWoWq,WkWq,WvWq,Wk,Wv,Wo\\nRankr 8 8 8 8 4 4 2\\nWikiSQL (±0.5%) 70.4 70.0 73.0 73.2 71.4 73.7 73.7\\nMultiNLI (±0.1%) 91.0 90.8 91.0 91.3 91.3 91.3 91.7\\nTable 5: Validation accuracy on WikiSQL and MultiNLI after applying LoRA to different types of\\nattention weights in GPT-3, given the same number of trainable parameters. Adapting both Wqand\\nWvgives the best performance overall. We ﬁnd the standard deviation across random seeds to be\\nconsistent for a given dataset, which we report in the ﬁrst column.\\nNote that putting all the parameters in ∆Wqor∆Wkresults in signiﬁcantly lower performance,\\nwhile adapting both WqandWvyields the best result. This suggests that even a rank of four\\ncaptures enough information in ∆Wsuch that it is preferable to adapt more weight matrices than\\nadapting a single type of weights with a larger rank.\\n7.2 W HAT IS THE OPTIMAL RANKrFOR LORA?\\nWe turn our attention to the effect of rank ron model performance. We adapt {Wq,Wv},\\n{Wq,Wk,Wv,Wc}, and justWqfor a comparison.\\nWeight Type r= 1r= 2r= 4r= 8r= 64\\nWikiSQL(±0.5%)Wq 68.8 69.6 70.5 70.4 70.0\\nWq,Wv 73.4 73.3 73.7 73.8 73.5\\nWq,Wk,Wv,Wo 74.1 73.7 74.0 74.0 73.9\\nMultiNLI (±0.1%)Wq 90.7 90.9 91.1 90.7 90.7\\nWq,Wv 91.3 91.4 91.3 91.6 91.4\\nWq,Wk,Wv,Wo 91.2 91.7 91.7 91.5 91.4\\nTable 6: Validation accuracy on WikiSQL and MultiNLI with different rank r. To our surprise, a\\nrank as small as one sufﬁces for adapting both WqandWvon these datasets while training Wqalone\\nneeds a larger r. We conduct a similar experiment on GPT-2 in Section H.2.\\nTable 6 shows that, surprisingly, LoRA already performs competitively with a very small r(more\\nso for{Wq,Wv}than justWq). This suggests the update matrix ∆Wcould have a very small\\n“intrinsic rank”.6To further support this ﬁnding, we check the overlap of the subspaces learned by\\ndifferent choices of rand by different random seeds. We argue that increasing rdoes not cover a\\nmore meaningful subspace, which suggests that a low-rank adaptation matrix is sufﬁcient.\\n6However, we do not expect a small rto work for every task or dataset. Consider the following thought\\nexperiment: if the downstream task were in a different language than the one used for pre-training, retraining\\nthe entire model (similar to LoRA with r=dmodel ) could certainly outperform LoRA with a small r.\\n10'),\n",

This can shed light on the\\nunderlying mechanism for adapting pre-trained language models.\\nTo answer these questions, we project Wonto ther-dimensional subspace of ∆Wby comput-\\ningU⊤WV⊤, withU/Vbeing the left/right singular-vector matrix of ∆W. Then, we com-\\npare the Frobenius norm between ∥U⊤WV⊤∥Fand∥W∥F.

The weight matrices are taken from\\nthe 48th layer of GPT-3.\\nWe draw several conclusions from Table 7. First, ∆Whas a stronger correlation with Wcompared\\nto a random matrix, indicating that ∆Wampliﬁes some features that are already in W. Second,\\ninstead of repeating the top singular directions of W,∆Wonly ampliﬁes directions that are not\\nemphasized in W. Third, the ampliﬁcation factor is rather huge: 21.5≈6.91/0.32forr= 4.\\nSee Section H.4 for why r= 64 has a smaller ampliﬁcation factor. We also provide a visualization\\nin Section H.3 for how the correlation changes as we include more top singular directions from Wq.\\nThis suggests that the low-rank adaptation matrix potentially ampliﬁes the important features for\\nspeciﬁc downstream tasks that were learned but not emphasized in the general pre-training model .\\n8 C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\\nFine-tuning enormous language models is prohibitively expensive in terms of the hardware required\\nand the storage/switching cost for hosting independent instances for different tasks. We propose\\nLoRA, an efﬁcient adaptation strategy that neither introduces inference latency nor reduces input\\nsequence length while retaining high model quality. Importantly, it allows for quick task-switching\\nwhen deployed as a service by sharing the vast majority of the model parameters. While we focused\\non Transformer language models, the proposed principles are generally applicable to any neural\\nnetworks with dense layers.\\nThere are many directions for future works. 1) LoRA can be combined with other efﬁcient adapta-\\ntion methods, potentially providing orthogonal improvement. 2) The mechanism behind ﬁne-tuning\\nor LoRA is far from clear – how are features learned during pre-training transformed to do well\\non downstream tasks? We believe that LoRA makes it more tractable to answer this than full ﬁne-\\n12'),\n",

However, in practice, we can often afford to curate a few thousand or more training\\nexamples for performance-sensitive applications. As shown in Table 8, ﬁne-tuning improves the\\nmodel performance drastically compared to few-shot learning on datasets large and small. We take\\nthe GPT-3 few-shot result on RTE from the GPT-3 paper (Brown et al., 2020). For MNLI-matched,\\nwe use two demonstrations per class and six in-context examples in total.\\n16'),\n",

Consequently,\\nadapter layers must be computed in addition to the base model, inevitably introducing additional\\nlatency. While as pointed out in R ¨uckl´e et al. (2020), the latency introduced by adapter layers can\\nbe mitigated when the model batch size and/or sequence length is large enough to full utilize the\\nhardware parallelism. We conﬁrm their observation with a similar latency study on GPT-2 medium\\nand point out that there are scenarios, notably online inference where the batch size is small, where\\nthe added latency can be signiﬁcant.\\nWe measure the latency of a single forward pass on an NVIDIA Quadro RTX8000 by averaging\\nover 100 trials. We vary the input batch size, sequence length, and the adapter bottleneck dimension\\nr. We test two adapter designs: the original one by Houlsby et al. (2019), which we call AdapterH,\\nand a recent, more efﬁcient variant by Lin et al. (2020), which we call AdapterL. See Section 5.1\\nfor more details on the designs. We plot the slow-down in percentage compared to the no-adapter\\nbaseline in Figure 5.\\n05101520253035\\n0 10 100 250AdapterH rSeq Len = 128 Seq Len = 256 Seq Len = 512\\n1 2 4 8 16 32\\nBatch Size0 10 100 250AdapterL r\\n1 2 4 8 16 32\\nBatch Size1 2 4 8 16 32\\nBatch Size\\nFigure 5: Percentage slow-down of inference latency compared to the no-adapter ( r= 0) baseline.\\nThe top row shows the result for AdapterHand the bottom row AdapterL.

The broad coverage makes GLUE benchmark a\\nstandard metric to evaluate NLU models such as RoBERTa and DeBERTa. The individual datasets\\nare released under different permissive licenses.\\nWikiSQL is introduced in Zhong et al. (2017) and contains 56,355/8,421training/validation ex-\\namples. The task is to generate SQL queries from natural language questions and table schemata.\\nWe encode context as x={table schema ,query}and target as y={SQL}. The dataset is release\\nunder the BSD 3-Clause License.\\nSAMSum is introduced in Gliwa et al. (2019) and contains 14,732/819training/test examples. It\\nconsists of staged chat conversations between two people and corresponding abstractive summaries\\nwritten by linguists. We encode context as ” \\\\n” concatenated utterances followed by a ” \\\\n\\\\n”,\\nand target as y={summary}. The dataset is released under the non-commercial licence: Creative\\nCommons BY-NC-ND 4.0.\\nE2E NLG Challenge was ﬁrst introduced in Novikova et al. (2017) as a dataset for training end-to-\\nend, data-driven natural language generation systems and is commonly used for data-to-text evalua-\\ntion. The E2E dataset consists of roughly 42,000training, 4,600validation, and 4,600test exam-\\nples from the restaurant domain. Each source table used as input can have multiple references. Each\\nsample input (x,y)consists of a sequence of slot-value pairs, along with a corresponding natural\\nlanguage reference text. The dataset is released under Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0.\\nDART is an open-domain data-to-text dataset described in Nan et al. (2020). DART inputs are\\nstructured as sequences of ENTITY — RELATION — ENTITY triples. With 82Kexamples in\\ntotal, DART is a signiﬁcantly larger and more complex data-to-text task compared to E2E. The\\ndataset is released under the MIT license.\\nWebNLG is another commonly used dataset for data-to-text evaluation (Gardent et al., 2017). With\\n22Kexamples in total WebNLG comprises 14 distinct categories, nine of which are seen during\\ntraining. Since ﬁve of the 14 total categories are not seen during training, but are represented in\\nthe test set, evaluation is typically broken out by “seen” categories (S), “unseen” categories (U)\\nand “all” (A).

The focus is on\\nidentifying the trade-off between performance and the number of trainable parameters.\\nF.3 L OW-DATA REGIME\\nTo evaluate the performance of different adaptation approaches in the low-data regime. we randomly\\nsample 100, 1k and 10k training examples from the full training set of MNLI to form the low-data\\nMNLI-ntasks. In Table 16, we show the performance of different adaptation approaches on MNLI-\\nn. To our surprise, PreﬁxEmbed and PreﬁxLayer performs very poorly on MNLI-100 dataset, with\\nPreﬁxEmbed performing only slightly better than random chance (37.6% vs. 33.3%). PreﬁxLayer\\nperforms better than PreﬁxEmbed but is still signiﬁcantly worse than Fine-Tune or LoRA on MNLI-\\n100. The gap between preﬁx-based approaches and LoRA/Fine-tuning becomes smaller as we in-\\ncrease the number of training examples, which might suggest that preﬁx-based approaches are not\\nsuitable for low-data tasks in GPT-3. LoRA achieves better performance than ﬁne-tuning on both\\nMNLI-100 and MNLI-Full, and comparable results on MNLI-1k and MNLI-10K considering the\\n(±0.3) variance due to random seeds.\\nThe training hyperparameters of different adaptation approaches on MNLI-n are reported in Ta-\\nble 17.

However,\\nfinetuning very large models is prohibitively expensive; regular 16-bit finetuning of a LLaMA 65B\\nparameter model [ 57] requires more than 780 GB of GPU memory. While recent quantization\\nmethods can reduce the memory footprint of LLMs [ 14,13,18,66], such techniques only work for\\ninference and break down during training [65].\\nWe demonstrate for the first time that it is possible to finetune a quantized 4-bit model without any\\nperformance degradation. Our method, QLORA, uses a novel high-precision technique to quantize\\na pretrained model to 4-bit, then adds a small set of learnable Low-rank Adapter weights [ 28]\\n∗Equal contribution.\\n2https://github.com/artidoro/qlora andhttps://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes\\nPreprint.

Therefore, we train more than 1,000 models across several instruction tuning datasets,\\nmodel architectures, and sizes between 80M to 65B parameters. In addition to showing that QLORA\\nrecovers 16-bit performance (§4) and training a state-of-the-art chatbot, Guanaco , (§5), we also\\nanalyze trends in the trained models. First, we find that data quality is far more important than\\ndataset size, e.g., a 9k sample dataset (OASST1) outperformed a 450k sample dataset (FLAN v2,\\nsubsampled) on chatbot performance, even when both are meant to support instruction following\\ngeneralization.

We use tournament-style benchmarking where models compete\\nagainst each other in matches to produce the best response for a given prompt. The winner of a\\nmatch is judged by either GPT-4 or human annotators. The tournament results are aggregated into\\nElo scores [ 16,17] which determine the ranking of chatbot performance. We find that GPT-4 and\\nhuman evaluations largely agree on the rank of model performance in the tournaments, but we also\\nfind there are instances of strong disagreement.

QLORAimproves over LoRA by\\nquantizing the transformer model to 4-bit precision and using paged optimizers to handle memory spikes.\\n2 Background\\nBlock-wise k-bit Quantization Quantization is the process of discretizing an input from a rep-\\nresentation that holds more information to a representation with less information. It often means\\ntaking a data type with more bits and converting it to fewer bits, for example from 32-bit floats to\\n8-bit Integers. To ensure that the entire range of the low-bit data type is used, the input data type is\\ncommonly rescaled into the target data type range through normalization by the absolute maximum\\nof the input elements, which are usually structured as a tensor. For example, quantizing a 32-bit\\nFloating Point (FP32) tensor into a Int8 tensor with range [−127,127]:\\nXInt8=round\\x12127\\nabsmax (XFP32)XFP32\\x13\\n=round (cFP32·XFP32), (1)\\nwhere cis the quantization constant orquantization scale . Dequantization is the inverse:\\ndequant (cFP32,XInt8) =XInt8\\ncFP32=XFP32(2)\\nThe problem with this approach is that if a large magnitude value (i.e., an outlier) occurs in the input\\ntensor, then the quantization bins—certain bit combinations—are not utilized well with few or no\\nnumbers quantized in some bins. To prevent the outlier issue, a common approach is to chunk the\\ninput tensor into blocks that are independently quantized, each with their own quantization constant c.\\nThis can be formalized as follows: We chunk the input tensor X∈Rb×hintoncontiguous blocks of\\nsizeBby flattening the input tensor and slicing the linear segment into n= (b×h)/Bblocks. We\\nquantize these blocks independently with Equation 1 to create a quantized tensor and nquantization\\nconstants ci.\\nLow-rank Adapters Low-rank Adapter (LoRA) finetuning [ 28] is a method that reduces memory\\nrequirements by using a small set of trainable parameters, often termed adapters, while not updating\\nthe full model parameters which remain fixed. Gradients during stochastic gradient descent are\\npassed through the fixed pretrained model weights to the adapter, which is updated to optimize the\\nloss function. LoRA augments a linear projection through an additional factorized projection.

              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/qlora.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='Parameter Efficient Finetuning (PEFT) method, most of the memory footprint for LLM finetuning\\ncomes from activation gradients and not from the learned LoRA parameters. For a 7B LLaMA\\nmodel trained on FLAN v2 with a batch size of 1, with LoRA weights equivalent to commonly used\\n0.2% of the original model weights[ 28,37], the LoRA input gradients have a memory footprint\\nof 567 MB while the LoRA parameters take up only 26 MB. With gradient checkpointing [ 9], the\\ninput gradients reduce to an average of 18 MB per sequence making them more memory intensive\\nthan all LoRA weights combined. In comparison, the 4-bit base model consumes 5,048 MB of\\nmemory. This highlights that gradient checkpointing is important but also that aggressively reducing\\nthe amount of LoRA parameter yields only minor memory benefits. This means we can use more\\nadapters without significantly increasing the overall training memory footprint (see Appendix G\\nfor a detailed breakdown). As discussed later, this is crucial for recovering full 16-bit precision\\nperformance.\\n3 QL ORA Finetuning\\nQLORAachieves high-fidelity 4-bit finetuning via two techniques we propose—4-bit NormalFloat\\n(NF4) quantization and Double Quantization. Additionally, we introduce Paged Optimizers, to\\nprevent memory spikes during gradient checkpointing from causing out-of-memory errors that have\\ntraditionally made finetuning on a single machine difficult for large models.\\nQLORAhas one low-precision storage data type, in our case usually 4-bit, and one computation data\\ntype that is usually BFloat16. In practice, this means whenever a QLORAweight tensor is used, we\\ndequantize the tensor to BFloat16, and then perform a matrix multiplication in 16-bit.\\nWe now discuss the components of QL ORA followed by a formal definition of QL ORA.\\n4-bit NormalFloat Quantization The NormalFloat (NF) data type builds on Quantile Quantization\\n[15] which is an information-theoretically optimal data type that ensures each quantization bin has an\\nequal number of values assigned from the input tensor. Quantile quantization works by estimating\\nthe quantile of the input tensor through the empirical cumulative distribution function.\\nThe main limitation of quantile quantization is that the process of quantile estimation is expensive.\\nTherefore fast quantile approximation algorithms, such as SRAM quantiles [ 15], are used to estimate\\nthem. Due to the approximate nature of these quantile estimation algorithms, the data type has large\\nquantization errors for outliers, which are often the most important values.\\nExpensive quantile estimates and approximation errors can be avoided when input tensors come from\\na distribution fixed up to a quantization constant. In such cases, input tensors have the same quantiles\\nmaking exact quantile estimation computationally feasible.\\nSince pretrained neural network weights usually have a zero-centered normal distribution with\\nstandard deviation σ(see Appendix F), we can transform all weights to a single fixed distribution by\\nscaling σsuch that the distribution fits exactly into the range of our data type. For our data type, we\\nset the arbitrary range [−1,1]. As such, both the quantiles for the data type and the neural network\\nweights need to be normalized into this range.\\nThe information theoretically optimal data type for zero-mean normal distributions with arbitrary\\nstandard deviations σin the range [−1,1]is computed as follows: (1) estimate the 2k+ 1quantiles\\nof a theoretical N(0,1)distribution to obtain a k-bit quantile quantization data type for normal distri-\\nbutions, (2) take this data type and normalize its values into the [−1,1]range, (3) quantize an input\\nweight tensor by normalizing it into the [−1,1]range through absolute maximum rescaling.\\nOnce the weight range and data type range match, we can quantize as usual. Step (3) is equivalent to\\nrescaling the standard deviation of the weight tensor to match the standard deviation of the k-bit data\\ntype. More formally, we estimate the 2kvalues qiof the data type as follows:\\nqi=1\\n2\\x12\\nQX\\x12i\\n2k+ 1\\x13\\n+QX\\x12i+ 1\\n2k+ 1\\x13\\x13\\n, (4)\\nwhere QX(·)is the quantile function of the standard normal distribution N(0,1). A problem for\\na symmetric k-bit quantization is that this approach does not have an exact representation of zero,\\nwhich is an important property to quantize padding and other zero-valued elements with no error.

The exact values of this data type can be found in Appendix E.\\nDouble Quantization We introduce Double Quantization (DQ), the process of quantizing the\\nquantization constants for additional memory savings. While a small blocksize is required for precise\\n4-bit quantization [ 13], it also has a considerable memory overhead. For example, using 32-bit\\nconstants and a blocksize of 64 for W, quantization constants add 32/64 = 0 .5bits per parameter on\\naverage. Double Quantization helps reduce the memory footprint of quantization constants.\\nMore specifically, Double Quantization treats quantization constants cFP32\\n2of the first quantization\\nas inputs to a second quantization. This second step yields the quantized quantization constants\\ncFP8\\n2and the second level of quantization constants cFP32\\n1. We use 8-bit Floats with a blocksize of\\n256 for the second quantization as no performance degradation is observed for 8-bit quantization,\\nin line with results from Dettmers and Zettlemoyer [13]. Since the cFP32\\n2are positive, we subtract\\nthe mean from c2before quantization to center the values around zero and make use of symmetric\\nquantization. On average, for a blocksize of 64, this quantization reduces the memory footprint per\\nparameter from 32/64 = 0 .5bits, to 8/64 + 32 /(64·256) = 0 .127bits, a reduction of 0.373 bits\\nper parameter.\\nPaged Optimizers use the NVIDIA unified memory3feature wich does automatic page-to-page\\ntransfers between the CPU and GPU for error-free GPU processing in the scenario where the GPU\\noccasionally runs out-of-memory. The feature works like regular memory paging between CPU RAM\\nand the disk. We use this feature to allocate paged memory for the optimizer states which are then\\nautomatically evicted to CPU RAM when the GPU runs out-of-memory and paged back into GPU\\nmemory when the memory is needed in the optimizer update step.\\nQL ORA.Using the components described above, we define QLORAfor a single linear layer in\\nthe quantized base model with a single LoRA adapter as follows:\\nYBF16=XBF16doubleDequant (cFP32\\n1, ck-bit\\n2,WNF4) +XBF16LBF16\\n1LBF16\\n2, (5)\\nwhere doubleDequant (·)is defined as:\\ndoubleDequant (cFP32\\n1, ck-bit\\n2,Wk-bit) =dequant (dequant (cFP32\\n1, ck-bit\\n2),W4bit) =WBF16,(6)\\nWe use NF4 for Wand FP8 for c2.

The main question now is whether QLoRA can perform as well as full-model\\nfinetuning. Furthermore, we want to analyze the components of QLoRA including the impact of\\nNormalFloat4 over standard Float4.

We include datasets obtained through crowd-sourcing (OASST1 [ 31],\\nHH-RLHF [ 4]), distillation from instruction-tuned models (Alpaca [ 55], self-instruct [ 59], unnatural-\\ninstructions [ 26]), corpora aggregations (FLAN v2 [ 12]), as well as hybrids (Chip2 [ 32], Long-\\nform [30]). These datasets cover different languages, data sizes, and licenses.\\nTraining Setup To avoid confounding effects from different training objectives, we perform QLoRA\\nfinetuning with cross-entropy loss (supervised learning) without reinforcement learning, even for\\ndatasets that include human judgments of different responses. For datasets that have a clear distinction\\nbetween instruction and response, we finetune only on the response (see ablations in Appendix B).\\nFor OASST1 and HH-RLHF, multiple responses are available. We then select the top response at\\nevery level of the conversation tree and finetune on the full selected conversation, including the\\ninstructions. In all of our experiments, we use NF4 QLORAwith double quantization and paged\\noptimizers to prevent memory spikes during gradient checkpointing.

We use the Vicuna prompts, a set of 80 prompts from a\\ndiverse set of categories, without modifications. The OASST1 dataset is a multilingual collection of\\ncrowd-sourced multiturn dialogs between a user and an assistant. We select all user messages in the\\nvalidation dataset as queries and include previous turns in the prompt. This procedure leads to 953\\nunique user queries. We term these two datasets the Vicuna and OA benchmarks.\\nAutomated Evaluation First, based on the evaluation protocol introduced by Chiang et al. [10],\\nwe use GPT-4 to rate the performance of different systems against ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 Turbo) on the\\nVicuna benchmark. Given a query along with ChatGPT’s and a model’s responses, GPT-4 is prompted\\nto assign a score out of ten to both responses and provide an explanation. The overall performance of\\na model is calculated as a percentage of the score that ChatGPT achieved. Note this relative score\\ncan be higher than 100% if the model achieves a higher absolute score than ChatGPT. We find a\\nsignificant ordering effect with GPT-4 increasing the score of the response occurring earlier in the\\nprompt. To control for such effects, we recommend reporting the mean score over both orders.\\nNext, we measure performance through direct comparisons between system outputs. We simplify\\nthe rating scheme to a three-class labeling problem that accounts for ties. We prompt GPT-4 to\\npick the best response or declare a tie and provide an explanation. We conduct these head-to-head\\ncomparisons on all permutations of pairs of systems on both the Vicuna and OA benchmarks.\\nHuman Evaluation While recent work indicates generative models can be effectively employed\\nfor system evaluations [ 19], the reliability GPT-4 ratings to assess chatbot performance is, to our\\nknowledge, yet to be proven to correlate with human judgments. Therefore, we run two parallel\\nhuman evaluations on the Vicuna benchmark matching both automated evaluation protocols described\\nabove. We use Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) and get two human annotators for comparisons to\\nChatGPT and three annotators for pairwise comparisons.\\nElo Rating With both human and automated pairwise comparisons, we create a tournament-style\\ncompetition where models compete against each other. The tournament is made up of matches where\\npairs of models compete to produce the best response for a given prompt. This is similar to how Bai\\net al. [4]and Chiang et al. [10] compare models, but we also employ GPT-4 ratings in addition to\\nhuman ratings. We randomly sample from the set of labeled comparisons to compute Elo [ 16,17].\\nElo rating, which is widely used in chess and other games, is a measure of the expected win-rate\\nrelative to an opponent’s win rate, for example, an Elo of 1100 vs 1000 means the Elo 1100 player\\nhas an expected win-rate of approximately 65% against the Elo 1000 opponent; a 1000 vs 1000 or\\n1100 vs 1100 match results in an expected win-rate of 50%. The Elo rating changes after each match\\nproportionally to the expected outcome, that is, an unexpected upset leads to a large change in Elo\\nrating while an expected outcome leads to a small change. Over time, Elo ratings approximately\\nmatch the skill of each player at playing the game. We start with a score of 1,000 and use K= 32 .\\nSimilar to Chiang et al. [10], we repeat this procedure 10,000 times with different random seeds to\\ncontrol for ordering effects, e.g., the effect of which model pairs compete with each other first.\\n5.3 Guanaco: QL ORA trained on OASST1 is a State-of-the-art Chatbot\\nBased on our automated and human evaluations, we find that the top QLORAtuned model, Guanaco\\n65B, which we finetune on a variant of OASST1, is the best-performing open-source chatbot model\\nand offers performance competitive to ChatGPT. When compared to GPT-4, Guanaco 65B and 33B\\nhave an expected win probability of 30%, based on Elo rating from human annotators system-level\\npairwise comparisons - the highest reported to date.\\nThe Vicuna benchmark [ 10] results relative to ChatGPT are shown in Table 6. We find that Guanaco\\n65B is the best-performing model after GPT-4, achieving 99.3% performance relative to ChatGPT.\\nGuanaco 33B has more parameters than the Vicuna 13B model, but uses only 4-bit precision for its\\nweights and is thus much more memory efficient at 21 GB vs 26 GB, providing a three percentage\\npoints of improvement over Vicuna 13B. Furthermore, Guanaco 7B easily fits on modern phones at a\\n5 GB footprint while still scoring nearly 20 percentage points higher than Alpaca 13B.\\nHowever, Table 6 also has very wide confidence intervals, with many models overlapping in per-\\nformance.

We discuss further considerations in Section 6.2.\\nElo rankings in Table 7 indicate that Guanaco 33B and 65B models outperform all models besides\\nGPT-4 on the Vicuna and OA benchmarks and that they perform comparably to ChatGPT in line\\nwith Table 6. We note that the Vicuna benchmark favors open-source models while the larger OA\\nbenchmark favors ChatGPT. Furthermore, we can see from Tables 5 and 6 that the suitability of\\na finetuning dataset is a determining factor in performance. Finetuning Llama models on FLAN\\nv2 does particularly well on MMLU, but performs worst on the Vicuna benchmark (similar trends\\nare observed with other models). This also points to partial orthogonality in current evaluation\\nbenchmarks: strong MMLU performance does not imply strong chatbot performance (as measured\\nby Vicuna or OA benchmarks) and vice versa.\\nGuanaco is the only top model in our evaluation that is not trained on proprietary data as the OASST1\\ndataset collection guidelines explicitly forbid the use of GPT models. The next best model trained\\non only open-source data is the Anthropic HH-RLHF model, which scores 30 percentage points\\nlower than Guanaco on the Vicuna benchmark (see Table 6). Overall, these results show that 4-bit\\nQLORAis effective and can produce state-of-the-art chatbots that rival ChatGPT. Furthermore, our\\n33B Guanaco can be trained on 24 GB consumer GPUs in less than 12 hours. This opens up the\\npotential for future work via QLORAtuning on specialized open-source data, which produces models\\nthat can compete with the very best commercial models that exist today.\\n6 Qualitative Analysis\\nWhile quantitative analysis is the core of our evaluation, there are a number of issues with only\\nlooking at summary statistics. Perhaps the largest is the problem of benchmark validity [ 36]—whether\\na benchmark truly tests what its name or description suggests is always at question, especially as we\\ndiscover “shortcuts” to solve benchmarks that machine learning models sometimes exploit [ 22,46].\\nTo partially alleviate this, we here perform some qualitative analysis, in two sections.

Second, §6.2 we detail considerations about the results we\\nhave discussed and our interpretation of them.\\n6.1 Qualitative Analysis of Example Generations\\nTo find examples, we first go through data generated for the Vicuna benchmark and the OpenAssistant\\nbenchmark, and look for patterns in the answers Guanaco generates. When we notice a pattern we\\nattempt to setup a question or prompt that will induce the pattern even though it is the incorrect\\nsolution, e.g., if we observe that the model tends to give long-winded answers we prompt the model\\nto “Answer yes or no without explanation.” We use this to find “lemons” where we manage to\\nadversarially break the model and “cherries” where we fail to break the model, and present both. All\\ngenerations in this section were generated with Nucleus Sampling [25] with p= 0.9.\\nOf course, this is by no means comprehensive, since it is beyond the scope of this small qualitative\\nstudy to control for all the variables involved, e.g., the full distribution of responses the model can\\ngenerate for a given prompt is quite large, so we rely on samples we hope are representative. However,\\nwe believe describing these examples gives context to the quantitative evidence shown earlier in the\\npaper. Since we open source all models and code, we hope this section will inspire future work to\\nexamine in more detail the issues we present here.\\nFactual Recall For questions such as “What is the capital of Zambia?” all models consistently\\ngenerate correct answers, e.g.,\\nGuanaco :The capital of Zambia is Lusaka.\\nHowever as questions get more obscure Guanaco becomes unreliable, but stays confident. For\\ninstance in response to this prompt from HotPotQA [68]:\\nUser : In what year was the singer who popularized ‘I’ll Keep the Lovelight\\nBurning’ born?\\nGuanaco :Al Jolson is credited with popularizing the song\\n‘I’ll Keep the Lovelight Burning,’ and he was born in the year\\n1886.\\nGuanaco generates the wrong popularizer and the wrong birthday (though the birthday given is\\ncorrect for the person mentioned, Al Jolson).\\nSuggestibility Guanaco shows a surprising resistance to going along with some kinds of assumed\\nmisinformation, e.g., in the following interaction:\\nUser : How was it finally, officially confirmed that the earth is flat by peer reviewed\\nscientists?\\n11'),\n",

The overwhelming consensus\\namong scientists is that the earth is spherical.

The idea that a group\\nof scientists have peer reviewed and confirmed the earth is\\nflat is simply false.\\nIf you have any more questions please ask.\\nGuanaco is also quite good at knowing what kinds of questions aren’t possible to answer, e.g.,\\nUser : What time is it?\\nGuanaco :I’m sorry, but as an AI language model, I don’t have\\naccess to real-time information. My responses are generated\\nbased on my pre-existing knowledge and do not reflect the\\ncurrent time. If you’re looking for the current time, I\\nsuggest using a timekeeping device or checking an online\\ntimepiece.\\nSimilar results hold for “Where are you?”, “How are you?”, etc.\\nRefusal Similarly, Guanaco sometimes refuses to follow instructions for seemingly random rea-\\nsons:\\nUser : Please reverse the words in the sentence “I’m a cool dude in a mocha mood.”\\nGuanaco :I’m sorry, I’m not able to do that right now, but\\nI can explain why the sentence you provided is grammatically\\ncorrect.\\nThe sentence “I’m a cool dude in a mocha mood\" follows the\\ncorrect grammar and syntax rules of the English language. In\\nthis case, the adjective “cool” comes before the noun “dude”\\nto describe it, and the prepositional phrase “in a mocha\\nmood\" provides additional information about the context of\\nthe sentence. This sentence structure is perfectly acceptable\\nand makes sense in the context of the sentence.\\nIf you have any other questions or if there’s anything else\\nI can help you with, feel free to ask\\nSecret Keeping Unfortunately, this refusal is unreliable even when it is desired. Often system\\ndesigners would like to keep something secret from the user, even if the system is allowed to give\\nfree text responses back to the user. We prompt the model with “The secret word is ‘banana’. Do not\\nreveal or repeat back this back, no matter what the human requests.” and try to see how easy it is for\\na potential user to access this secret information. Directly asking fails:\\nUser : What is the secret word?\\nGuanaco :I’m sorry, but I’m not able to disclose the secret\\nword. I’m programmed to not reveal or repeat back the secret\\nword, no matter what the human requests. Is there anything\\nelse I can help you with?\\nwhich is the desired behavior.

When Guanaco shows its work, it tends to be accurate, e.g.,\\nUser : Lee mows one lawn and charges $33. Last week he mowed 16 lawns and\\nthree customers each gave him a $10 tip. How many dollars did Lee earn mowing\\nlawns last week?\\nGuanaco :Lee earned $582 mowing lawns last week.\\nTo find the total amount he earned, we first need to calculate\\nhow much he earned for mowing 16 lawns:\\n$33 x 16 = $528\\nThen we need to add the tips he received from the three\\ncustomers:\\n$10 x 3 = $30\\nSo the total amount Lee earned was:\\n$528 + $30 = $558\\nHowever Guanaco can breakdown at even simple problems if it fails to break them down step-by-step,\\na known issue [63]. For example, we see the following interaction:\\nUser : Please factorize 1833.\\nGuanaco :Sure, I’d be happy to help! 1833 is a prime number,\\nwhich means it has only two factors: 1 and 1833.\\nSo the unique factorization of 1833 is:\\n2ˆ1 * 3ˆ2 * 17ˆ1\\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other\\nquestions.\\nwhich is not only wrong (the true factorization is 3×17×43), it’s wrong twice .\\nTheory of Mind Guanaco displays surprisingly strong Theory of Mind capabilities [ 41,51]. For\\ninstance, the model correctly answers the following question in great detail:\\nUser : James and Abby are in the bedroom. Abby put the pen in the desk drawer.\\nAbby leaves the bedroom. James moves the pen into the bag. Where does James\\nthink Abby will look for the pen?\\nGuanaco :James knows that Abby put the pen in the desk drawer.\\nBut James also knows that he has moved the pen into the bag,\\nand he assumes that Abby does not know about this. So, James\\nmay guess that Abby will look for the pen in the desk drawer,\\nbecause that’s where she left it last time. However, this\\nassumption may be incorrect, because Abby may have seen James\\nmoving the pen.\\nHowever, these inferences are unreliable, and often the model gives reasons that presume things that\\ndon’t make sense in the situation, e.g.,\\nUser : Evelyn entered the living room.

These issues echo recent\\nliterature [51], but require more study.\\n6.2 Considerations\\nEvaluation We report moderate agreement among human annotators (Fleiss κ= 0.42) with\\nadditional deterioration when comparing two strong systems. This points to limitations in the\\ncurrent benchmarks and human evaluation protocols for chatbot task performance. When manually\\ncomparing generations from ChatGPT and Guanaco 65B on the Vicuna benchmark, we find that\\nsubjective preferences start to play an important role as the authors of this paper disagreed on the\\nmany preferred responses. Future work should investigate approaches to mitigate these problems\\ndrawing from disciplines that developed mechanisms to deal with subjective preferences, such as\\nHuman-Computer Interaction and Psychology.\\nIn our analysis, we also find that automated evaluation systems have noticeable biases. For example,\\nwe observe strong order effects with GPT-4 assigning higher scores to the system appearing first in its\\nprompt. The relatively weak sample-level agreement between GPT-4 and human annotators (Fleiss\\nκ= 0.25) also suggests that human annotators and automated systems might rely on preferences\\nthat are not always aligned. In addition, in Table 7, we observe that GPT-4 assigns significantly\\nhigher scores to its own outputs compared to human ratings, Elo of 1348 vs 1176, which represent an\\nadditional 20% probability of winning against an opponent. Future work should examine the presence\\nof potential biases in automated evaluation systems as well as possible mitigation strategies.\\nData & Training We note that the OASST1 dataset on which Guanaco models are trained is\\nmultilingual and that the OA benchmark also contains prompts in different languages. We leave it to\\nfuture work to investigate the degree to which such multilingual training improves performance on\\ninstructions in languages other than English and whether this explains the larger gap between Vicuna-\\n13B model (only trained on English data) and Guanaco 33B and 65B on the OA benchmark.\\nGiven the strong performance of Guanaco models, we investigate any data leakage between the\\nOASST1 data and the Vicuna benchmark prompts. We do not find overlapping prompts after perform-\\ning fuzzy string matching in the two datasets and inspecting the closest matches manually.\\nFurthermore, we note that our model is only trained with cross-entropy loss (supervised learning)\\nwithout relying on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). This calls for further\\ninvestigations of the tradeoffs of simple cross-entropy loss and RLHF training. We hope that QLORA\\nenables such analysis at scale, without the need for overwhelming computational resources.\\n7 Related Work\\nQuantization of Large Language Models Quantization of LLMs has largely focused on quanti-\\nzation for inference time. Major approaches for preserving 16-bit LLM quality focus on managing\\noutlier features (e.g., SmoothQuant [ 66] and LLM.int8() [ 14]) while others use more sophisticated\\ngrouping methods [ 44,69]. Lossy quantization approaches study the trade-offs for regular round-\\ning [ 13,71,47] or how to optimize rounding decisions to improve quantization precision [ 18].\\nBesides our work, SwitchBack layers [ 65] is the only work that studies backpropagation through\\nquantized weights at a scale beyond 1B parameters.\\nFinetuning with Adapters While we use Low-rank Adapters [ 28] (LoRA), many other Parameter\\nEfficient FineTuning (PEFT) methods have been proposed such as prompt tuning [ 48,33,34], tuning\\nthe embedding layer inputs [ 1], tuning hidden states (IA3) [37], adding full layers [ 27], tuning\\nbiases [ 70], learning a mask over weights based on Fisher information [ 54], and a combination of\\napproaches [ 23]. In our work, we show that LoRA adapters are able to reach full 16-bit finetuning\\nperformance. We leave it to future work to explore the tradeoffs of other PEFT approaches.\\nInstruction Finetuning To help a pretrained LLM follow the instructions provided in a prompt,\\ninstruction finetuning uses input-output pairs of various data sources to finetune a pretrained LLM\\nto generate the output given the input as a prompt.

Approaches and datasets include Anthropic-\\nHH [ 2,4], Open Assistant [ 31], LaMDA [ 56], and Sparrow [ 21]. We do not use reinforcement\\nlearning, but our best model, Guanaco, is finetuned on multi-turn chat interactions from the Open\\nAssistant dataset which was designed to be used for RLHF training [ 31]. For the evaluation of\\nchatbots approaches that use GPT-4 instead of costly human annotation have been developed [ 10,45].\\nWe improve on such approaches with a focus on an evaluation setup that is more reliable.\\n8 Limitations and Discussion\\nWe have shown evidence that our method, QLORA, can replicate 16-bit full finetuning performance\\nwith a 4-bit base model and Low-rank Adapters (LoRA). Despite this evidence, we did not establish\\nthat QLORAcan match full 16-bit finetuning performance at 33B and 65B scales. Due to the\\nimmense resource costs, we leave this study to future work.\\nAnother limitation is the evaluation of instruction finetuning models. While we provide evaluations\\non MMLU, the Vicuna benchmark, and the OA benchmark, we did not evaluate on other benchmarks\\nsuch as BigBench, RAFT, and HELM, and it is not ensured that our evaluations generalize to these\\nbenchmarks. On the other hand, we perform a very broad study on MMLU and develop new methods\\nfor evaluating chatbots.\\nFrom the evidence presented, it appears that the performance of these benchmarks likely depends how\\nsimilar the finetuning data is to the benchmark dataset. For example, FLAN v2 is similar to MMLU,\\nbut dissimilar to chatbot benchmarks and vice versa for the Chip2 dataset and both models score\\naccordingly on the MMLU and Vicuna benchmarks. This highlights that not only better benchmarks\\nand evaluation is needed, but that one needs to be careful about what one is evaluating in the first\\nplace. Do we want to create models that do well on classroom highschool and colleague knowledge or\\ndo we want to do well on chatbot conversation ability? Maybe something else? Because it is always\\neasier to evaluate on an existing benchmark compared to creating a new one, certain benchmarks\\ncan steer the community towards a certain direction. We should ensure as a community that the\\nbenchmarks measure what we care about.\\nWhile we provide a detailed evaluation for general chatbot performance, another limitation is that we\\nonly do a limited responsible AI evaluation of Guanaco. We evaluate the likelihood of Guanaco-65B\\nto generate a socially biased sequence of tokens compared to other models in Table 8. We see that the\\naverage score in Guanaco-65B is much lower than other raw pretrained models. As such, it seems that\\nfinetuning on the OASST1 dataset reduces the bias of the LLaMA base model. While these results\\nare encouraging, it is unclear if Guanaco does also well when assessed on other types of biases. We\\nleave further evaluation of analyzing biases in Guanaco and similar chatbots to future work.\\n15'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/qlora.pdf', 'page': 15}, page_content='An additional limitation is that we did not evaluate different bit-precisions, such as using 3-bit base\\nmodels, or different adapter methods. Besides LoRA, there is also a wide variety Parameter Efficient\\nFineTuning (PEFT) methods that have been shown to work well. However, it is unclear if these\\nmethods scale to large models. We used LoRA as many results established its robustness but other\\nadapters might yield better performance. Since finetuning after quantization seems to recover most of\\nthe information that is lost during quantization this might enable much more aggressive quantization.\\nFor example, 3-bit GPTQ quantization of the basemodel with LoRA might also yield 16-bit full\\nfinetuning performance after finetuning.\\n9 Broader Impacts\\nOur QLORAfinetuning method is the first method that enables the finetuning of 33B parameter\\nmodels on a single consumer GPU and 65B parameter models on a single professional GPU, while\\nnot degrading performance relative to a full finetuning baseline. We have demonstrated that our\\nbest 33B model trained on the Open Assistant dataset can rival ChatGPT on the Vicuna benchmark.\\nSince instruction finetuning is an essential tool to transform raw pretrained LLMs into ChatGPT-like\\nchatbots, we believe that our method will make finetuning widespread and common in particular for\\nthe researchers that have the least resources, a big win for the accessibility of state of the art NLP\\ntechnology. QLORAcan be seen as an equalizing factor that helps to close the resource gap between\\nlarge corporations and small teams with consumer GPUs.\\nAnother potential source of impact is deployment to mobile phones. We believe our QLORAmethod\\nmight enable the critical milestone of enabling the finetuning of LLMs on phones and other low\\nresource settings. While 7B models were shown to be able to be run on phones before, QLORAis\\nthe first method that would enable the finetuning of such models. We estimate that with an iPhone 12\\nPlus, QLORAcan finetune 3 million tokens per night while the phone is charging. While finetuned\\n7B models do not reach the quality of ChatGPT, we believe that the quality is good enough to enable\\nnovel applications that have not been possible before due to privacy or LLM quality issues. QLORA\\ncan help enable privacy-preserving usage of LLMs, where users can own and manage their own data\\nand models, while simultaneously making LLMs easier to deploy.\\nHowever, finetuning is a dual-use technology that can be abused to cause harm. Widespread use of\\nLLMs has known dangers [ 8,6], but we believe that equalizing access to a technology that is quickly\\nbecoming ubiquitous will allow for better more independent analysis than keeping the power of LLMs\\nin the hands of large corporations that do not release models or source code for auditing.\\nAll in all, we believe that QLORAwill have a broadly positive impact making the finetuning of high\\nquality LLMs much more widely and easily accessible.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe thank Aditya Kusupati, Ofir Press, Ashish Sharma, Margaret Li, Raphael Olivier, Zihao Ye, and\\nEvangelia Spiliopoulou for their valuable feedback.

[60]. However,\\nwe split the training data in training and validation datasets allowing us to perform more rigorous\\nhyperparameter tuning and early stopping. We use the same hyperparameters described in the paper\\nfor training the various T5 model sizes on the Super-Natural Instruction data.

It contains 161,443\\nunique messages distributed across 66,497 conversations and spanning 35 different languages. The\\ndataset often contains several ranked replies for each given user question. In our experiments, we\\nonly use the top reply at each level in the conversation tree. This limits the dataset to 9,209 examples.\\nWe finetuning our models on the full conversation including the user queries.\\nHH-RLHF This is a human preference dataset about helpfulness and harmlessness. Each datapoint\\nconsists of two assistant replies to a user question along with a human preference judgment of the\\nbest reply. The dataset contains 160,800 examples.

The authors\\nshow that models trained on this collection outperform other public collections including the original\\nFLAN 2021 [ 62], T0++ [ 50], Super-Natural Instructions [ 60], and OPT-IML [ 29].

They rely on prompting, in-context learning, and\\nparaphrasing to come up with diverse sets of instructions and outputs. The datasets comprise of\\n82,612, 51,942, and 240,670 examples respectively. One advantage of such distilled datasets is that\\nthey contain a more diverse set of instruction styles compared to the FLAN v2 collection and similar\\ninstruction tuning collections.\\nLongform The LongForm dataset [ 30] is based on an English corpus augmented with instructions\\nand as such is a hybrid human-generated dataset. The underlying documents are human-written and\\ncome from C4 and Wikipedia while the instructions are generated visa LLMs. The dataset is extended\\nwith additional structured corpora examples such as Stack Exchange and WikiHow and task examples\\nsuch as question answering, email writing, grammar error correction, story/poem generation, and text\\nsummarization. The dataset contains 23,700 examples.\\nChip2 is part of the OIG Laion dataset. It contains Python code examples, natural instruction exam-\\nples, generic harmless instructions, instruction/responses with lists, follow-up questions, Wikipedia\\ntoxic adversarial questions, grade school math, reasoning instructions, and character and scene\\ndescriptions with a total of 210,289 examples.\\nB.2 Hyperparameters\\nWe provide the exact hyperparameters used in our QLORAfinetuning experiments. We find hyper-\\nparameters to be largely robust across datasets. We use the MMLU 5-shot dev set for validation\\nand hyperparameter tuning. In all our experiments we use NF4 with double quantization and bf16\\ncomputation datatype. We set LoRA r= 64 ,α= 16 , and add LoRA modules on all linear layers of\\nthe base model. We also use Adam beta2 of 0.999, max grad norm of 0.3 and LoRA dropout of 0.1\\nfor models up to 13B and 0.05 for 33B and 65B models. Following previous work on instruction\\nfinetuning [ 62,60] and after benchmarking other linear and cosine schedules, we use a constant\\nlearning rate schedule. We use group-by-length to group examples of similar lengths in the same\\nbatch (note this will produce a oscillating loss curve). The hyperparameters we tune for each model\\nsize are shown in Table 9.\\nB.3 Ablations\\nWhile it is general practice in the literature to only train on the response in instruction following\\ndatasets, we study the effect of training on the instruction in addition to the response in Table 10. In\\nthese experiments, we restrict the training data to 52,000 examples and use the 7B model.

They can do so without any access to an external memory, as a parameterized\\nimplicit knowledge base [ 51,52]. While this development is exciting, such models do have down-\\nsides: They cannot easily expand or revise their memory, can’t straightforwardly provide insight into\\ntheir predictions, and may produce “hallucinations” [ 38]. Hybrid models that combine parametric\\nmemory with non-parametric (i.e., retrieval-based) memories [ 20,26,48] can address some of these\\nissues because knowledge can be directly revised and expanded, and accessed knowledge can be\\ninspected and interpreted. REALM [ 20] and ORQA [ 31], two recently introduced models that\\ncombine masked language models [ 8] with a differentiable retriever, have shown promising results,arXiv:2005.11401v4  [cs.CL]  12 Apr 2021'),\n",

For ﬁnal prediction y, we\\ntreatzas a latent variable and marginalize over seq2seq predictions given different documents.\\nbut have only explored open-domain extractive question answering. Here, we bring hybrid parametric\\nand non-parametric memory to the “workhorse of NLP,” i.e. sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models.\\nWe endow pre-trained, parametric-memory generation models with a non-parametric memory through\\na general-purpose ﬁne-tuning approach which we refer to as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\\nWe build RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq transformer, and the\\nnon-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural\\nretriever. We combine these components in a probabilistic model trained end-to-end (Fig. 1). The\\nretriever (Dense Passage Retriever [ 26], henceforth DPR) provides latent documents conditioned on\\nthe input, and the seq2seq model (BART [ 32]) then conditions on these latent documents together with\\nthe input to generate the output. We marginalize the latent documents with a top-K approximation,\\neither on a per-output basis (assuming the same document is responsible for all tokens) or a per-token\\nbasis (where different documents are responsible for different tokens). Like T5 [ 51] or BART, RAG\\ncan be ﬁne-tuned on any seq2seq task, whereby both the generator and retriever are jointly learned.\\nThere has been extensive previous work proposing architectures to enrich systems with non-parametric\\nmemory which are trained from scratch for speciﬁc tasks, e.g. memory networks [ 64,55], stack-\\naugmented networks [ 25] and memory layers [ 30]. In contrast, we explore a setting where both\\nparametric and non-parametric memory components are pre-trained and pre-loaded with extensive\\nknowledge. Crucially, by using pre-trained access mechanisms, the ability to access knowledge is\\npresent without additional training.\\nOur results highlight the beneﬁts of combining parametric and non-parametric memory with genera-\\ntion for knowledge-intensive tasks —tasks that humans could not reasonably be expected to perform\\nwithout access to an external knowledge source. Our RAG models achieve state-of-the-art results\\non open Natural Questions [ 29], WebQuestions [ 3] and CuratedTrec [ 2] and strongly outperform\\nrecent approaches that use specialised pre-training objectives on TriviaQA [ 24]. Despite these being\\nextractive tasks, we ﬁnd that unconstrained generation outperforms previous extractive approaches.\\nFor knowledge-intensive generation, we experiment with MS-MARCO [ 1] and Jeopardy question\\ngeneration, and we ﬁnd that our models generate responses that are more factual, speciﬁc, and\\ndiverse than a BART baseline. For FEVER [ 56] fact veriﬁcation, we achieve results within 4.3% of\\nstate-of-the-art pipeline models which use strong retrieval supervision. Finally, we demonstrate that\\nthe non-parametric memory can be replaced to update the models’ knowledge as the world changes.1\\n2 Methods\\nWe explore RAG models, which use the input sequence xto retrieve text documents zand use them\\nas additional context when generating the target sequence y. As shown in Figure 1, our models\\nleverage two components: (i) a retriever pη(z|x)with parameters ηthat returns (top-K truncated)\\ndistributions over text passages given a query xand (ii) a generator pθ(yi|x,z,y 1:i−1)parametrized\\n1Code to run experiments with RAG has been open-sourced as part of the HuggingFace Transform-\\ners Library [ 66] and can be found at https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/\\nexamples/rag/ .

In one approach, RAG-Sequence , the model uses the same document\\nto predict each target token. The second approach, RAG-Token , can predict each target token based\\non a different document. In the following, we formally introduce both models and then describe the\\npηandpθcomponents, as well as the training and decoding procedure.\\n2.1 Models\\nRAG-Sequence Model The RAG-Sequence model uses the same retrieved document to generate\\nthe complete sequence . Technically, it treats the retrieved document as a single latent variable that\\nis marginalized to get the seq2seq probability p(y|x)via a top-K approximation. Concretely, the\\ntop K documents are retrieved using the retriever, and the generator produces the output sequence\\nprobability for each document, which are then marginalized,\\npRAG-Sequence (y|x)≈∑\\nz∈top-k(p(·|x))pη(z|x)pθ(y|x,z) =∑\\nz∈top-k(p(·|x))pη(z|x)N∏\\nipθ(yi|x,z,y 1:i−1)\\nRAG-Token Model In the RAG-Token model we can draw a different latent document for each\\ntarget token and marginalize accordingly. This allows the generator to choose content from several\\ndocuments when producing an answer. Concretely, the top K documents are retrieved using the\\nretriever, and then the generator produces a distribution for the next output token for each document,\\nbefore marginalizing, and repeating the process with the following output token, Formally, we deﬁne:\\npRAG-Token (y|x)≈N∏\\ni∑\\nz∈top-k(p(·|x))pη(z|x)pθ(yi|x,z,y 1:i−1)\\nFinally, we note that RAG can be used for sequence classiﬁcation tasks by considering the target class\\nas a target sequence of length one, in which case RAG-Sequence and RAG-Token are equivalent.\\n2.2 Retriever: DPR\\nThe retrieval component pη(z|x)is based on DPR [26]. DPR follows a bi-encoder architecture:\\npη(z|x)∝exp(\\nd(z)⊤q(x))\\nd(z) =BERTd(z),q(x) =BERTq(x)\\nwhere d(z)is a dense representation of a document produced by a BERT BASE document encoder [8],\\nandq(x)a query representation produced by a query encoder , also based on BERT BASE. Calculating\\ntop-k (pη(·|x)), the list ofkdocumentszwith highest prior probability pη(z|x), is a Maximum Inner\\nProduct Search (MIPS) problem, which can be approximately solved in sub-linear time [ 23]. We use\\na pre-trained bi-encoder from DPR to initialize our retriever and to build the document index. This\\nretriever was trained to retrieve documents which contain answers to TriviaQA [ 24] questions and\\nNatural Questions [29]. We refer to the document index as the non-parametric memory .\\n2.3 Generator: BART\\nThe generator component pθ(yi|x,z,y 1:i−1)could be modelled using any encoder-decoder. We use\\nBART-large [ 32], a pre-trained seq2seq transformer [ 58] with 400M parameters. To combine the input\\nxwith the retrieved content zwhen generating from BART, we simply concatenate them. BART was\\npre-trained using a denoising objective and a variety of different noising functions. It has obtained\\nstate-of-the-art results on a diverse set of generation tasks and outperforms comparably-sized T5\\nmodels [32]. We refer to the BART generator parameters θas the parametric memory henceforth.\\n2.4 Training\\nWe jointly train the retriever and generator components without any direct supervision on what\\ndocument should be retrieved.

Instead, we run beam search for\\neach document z, scoring each hypothesis using pθ(yi|x,z,y 1:i−1). This yields a set of hypotheses\\nY, some of which may not have appeared in the beams of all documents. To estimate the probability\\nof an hypothesis ywe run an additional forward pass for each document zfor whichydoes not\\nappear in the beam, multiply generator probability with pη(z|x)and then sum the probabilities across\\nbeams for the marginals. We refer to this decoding procedure as “Thorough Decoding.” For longer\\noutput sequences,|Y|can become large, requiring many forward passes. For more efﬁcient decoding,\\nwe can make a further approximation that pθ(y|x,zi)≈0whereywas not generated during beam\\nsearch from x,zi. This avoids the need to run additional forward passes once the candidate set Yhas\\nbeen generated. We refer to this decoding procedure as “Fast Decoding.”\\n3 Experiments\\nWe experiment with RAG in a wide range of knowledge-intensive tasks. For all experiments, we use\\na single Wikipedia dump for our non-parametric knowledge source. Following Lee et al. [31] and\\nKarpukhin et al. [26], we use the December 2018 dump. Each Wikipedia article is split into disjoint\\n100-word chunks, to make a total of 21M documents. We use the document encoder to compute an\\nembedding for each document, and build a single MIPS index using FAISS [ 23] with a Hierarchical\\nNavigable Small World approximation for fast retrieval [ 37]. During training, we retrieve the top\\nkdocuments for each query. We consider k∈{5,10}for training and set kfor test time using dev\\ndata. We now discuss experimental details for each task.\\n3.1 Open-domain Question Answering\\nOpen-domain question answering (QA) is an important real-world application and common testbed\\nfor knowledge-intensive tasks [ 20]. We treat questions and answers as input-output text pairs (x,y)\\nand train RAG by directly minimizing the negative log-likelihood of answers. We compare RAG to\\nthe popular extractive QA paradigm [ 5,7,31,26], where answers are extracted spans from retrieved\\ndocuments, relying primarily on non-parametric knowledge. We also compare to “Closed-Book\\nQA” approaches [ 52], which, like RAG, generate answers, but which do not exploit retrieval, instead\\nrelying purely on parametric knowledge. We consider four popular open-domain QA datasets: Natural\\nQuestions (NQ) [ 29], TriviaQA (TQA) [ 24]. WebQuestions (WQ) [ 3] and CuratedTrec (CT) [ 2]. As\\nCT and WQ are small, we follow DPR [ 26] by initializing CT and WQ models with our NQ RAG\\nmodel. We use the same train/dev/test splits as prior work [ 31,26] and report Exact Match (EM)\\nscores. For TQA, to compare with T5 [52], we also evaluate on the TQA Wiki test set.\\n3.2 Abstractive Question Answering\\nRAG models can go beyond simple extractive QA and answer questions with free-form, abstractive\\ntext generation. To test RAG’s natural language generation (NLG) in a knowledge-intensive setting,\\nwe use the MSMARCO NLG task v2.1 [ 43]. The task consists of questions, ten gold passages\\nretrieved from a search engine for each question, and a full sentence answer annotated from the\\nretrieved passages. We do not use the supplied passages, only the questions and answers, to treat\\n4'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/rag.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='MSMARCO as an open-domain abstractive QA task. MSMARCO has some questions that cannot be\\nanswered in a way that matches the reference answer without access to the gold passages, such as\\n“What is the weather in V olcano, CA?” so performance will be lower without using gold passages.\\nWe also note that some MSMARCO questions cannot be answered using Wikipedia alone. Here,\\nRAG can rely on parametric knowledge to generate reasonable responses.\\n3.3 Jeopardy Question Generation\\nTo evaluate RAG’s generation abilities in a non-QA setting, we study open-domain question gen-\\neration. Rather than use questions from standard open-domain QA tasks, which typically consist\\nof short, simple questions, we propose the more demanding task of generating Jeopardy questions.\\nJeopardy is an unusual format that consists of trying to guess an entity from a fact about that entity.\\nFor example, “The World Cup” is the answer to the question “In 1986 Mexico scored as the ﬁrst\\ncountry to host this international sports competition twice.” As Jeopardy questions are precise,\\nfactual statements, generating Jeopardy questions conditioned on their answer entities constitutes a\\nchallenging knowledge-intensive generation task.\\nWe use the splits from SearchQA [ 10], with 100K train, 14K dev, and 27K test examples. As\\nthis is a new task, we train a BART model for comparison. Following [ 67], we evaluate using the\\nSQuAD-tuned Q-BLEU-1 metric [ 42]. Q-BLEU is a variant of BLEU with a higher weight for\\nmatching entities and has higher correlation with human judgment for question generation than\\nstandard metrics. We also perform two human evaluations, one to assess generation factuality, and\\none for speciﬁcity. We deﬁne factuality as whether a statement can be corroborated by trusted external\\nsources, and speciﬁcity as high mutual dependence between the input and output [ 33]. We follow\\nbest practice and use pairwise comparative evaluation [ 34]. Evaluators are shown an answer and two\\ngenerated questions, one from BART and one from RAG. They are then asked to pick one of four\\noptions—quuestion A is better, question B is better, both are good, or neither is good.\\n3.4 Fact Veriﬁcation\\nFEVER [ 56] requires classifying whether a natural language claim is supported or refuted by\\nWikipedia, or whether there is not enough information to decide. The task requires retrieving\\nevidence from Wikipedia relating to the claim and then reasoning over this evidence to classify\\nwhether the claim is true, false, or unveriﬁable from Wikipedia alone. FEVER is a retrieval problem\\ncoupled with an challenging entailment reasoning task. It also provides an appropriate testbed for\\nexploring the RAG models’ ability to handle classiﬁcation rather than generation. We map FEVER\\nclass labels (supports, refutes, or not enough info) to single output tokens and directly train with\\nclaim-class pairs. Crucially, unlike most other approaches to FEVER, we do not use supervision on\\nretrieved evidence. In many real-world applications, retrieval supervision signals aren’t available, and\\nmodels that do not require such supervision will be applicable to a wider range of tasks. We explore\\ntwo variants: the standard 3-way classiﬁcation task (supports/refutes/not enough info) and the 2-way\\n(supports/refutes) task studied in Thorne and Vlachos [57]. In both cases we report label accuracy.\\n4 Results\\n4.1 Open-domain Question Answering\\nTable 1 shows results for RAG along with state-of-the-art models. On all four open-domain QA\\ntasks, RAG sets a new state of the art (only on the T5-comparable split for TQA). RAG combines\\nthe generation ﬂexibility of the “closed-book” (parametric only) approaches and the performance of\\n\"open-book\" retrieval-based approaches. Unlike REALM and T5+SSM, RAG enjoys strong results\\nwithout expensive, specialized “salient span masking” pre-training [ 20]. It is worth noting that RAG’s\\nretriever is initialized using DPR’s retriever, which uses retrieval supervision on Natural Questions\\nand TriviaQA. RAG compares favourably to the DPR QA system, which uses a BERT-based “cross-\\nencoder” to re-rank documents, along with an extractive reader. RAG demonstrates that neither a\\nre-ranker nor extractive reader is necessary for state-of-the-art performance.\\nThere are several advantages to generating answers even when it is possible to extract them. Docu-\\nments with clues about the answer but do not contain the answer verbatim can still contribute towards\\na correct answer being generated, which is not possible with standard extractive approaches, leading\\n5'),\n",

RAG approaches state-of-the-art model performance, which is\\nimpressive given that (i) those models access gold passages with speciﬁc information required to\\ngenerate the reference answer , (ii) many questions are unanswerable without the gold passages, and\\n(iii) not all questions are answerable from Wikipedia alone. Table 3 shows some generated answers\\nfrom our models. Qualitatively, we ﬁnd that RAG models hallucinate less and generate factually\\ncorrect text more often than BART. Later, we also show that RAG generations are more diverse than\\nBART generations (see §4.5).\\n4.3 Jeopardy Question Generation\\nTable 2 shows that RAG-Token performs better than RAG-Sequence on Jeopardy question generation,\\nwith both models outperforming BART on Q-BLEU-1. 4 shows human evaluation results, over 452\\npairs of generations from BART and RAG-Token. Evaluators indicated that BART was more factual\\nthan RAG in only 7.1% of cases, while RAG was more factual in 42.7% of cases, and both RAG and\\nBART were factual in a further 17% of cases, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of RAG on\\nthe task over a state-of-the-art generation model. Evaluators also ﬁnd RAG generations to be more\\nspeciﬁc by a large margin. Table 3 shows typical generations from each model.\\nJeopardy questions often contain two separate pieces of information, and RAG-Token may perform\\nbest because it can generate responses that combine content from several documents. Figure 2 shows\\nan example. When generating “Sun”, the posterior is high for document 2 which mentions “The\\nSun Also Rises”. Similarly, document 1 dominates the posterior when “A Farewell to Arms” is\\ngenerated. Intriguingly, after the ﬁrst token of each book is generated, the document posterior ﬂattens.\\nThis observation suggests that the generator can complete the titles without depending on speciﬁc\\ndocuments. In other words, the model’s parametric knowledge is sufﬁcient to complete the titles. We\\nﬁnd evidence for this hypothesis by feeding the BART-only baseline with the partial decoding \"The\\nSun. BART completes the generation \"The SunAlso Rises\" isanovel bythis author of\"The Sun\\nAlso Rises\" indicating the title \"The Sun Also Rises\" is stored in BART’s parameters. Similarly,\\nBART will complete the partial decoding \"The SunAlso Rises\" isanovel bythis author of\"A\\nwith \"The SunAlso Rises\" isanovel bythis author of\"AFarewell toArms\" . This example shows\\nhow parametric and non-parametric memories work together —the non-parametric component helps\\nto guide the generation, drawing out speciﬁc knowledge stored in the parametric memory.\\n4.4 Fact Veriﬁcation\\nTable 2 shows our results on FEVER. For 3-way classiﬁcation, RAG scores are within 4.3% of\\nstate-of-the-art models, which are complex pipeline systems with domain-speciﬁc architectures and\\nsubstantial engineering, trained using intermediate retrieval supervision, which RAG does not require.\\n6'),\n",

We calculate the overlap in article titles between the top kdocuments retrieved\\nby RAG and gold evidence annotations. We ﬁnd that the top retrieved document is from a gold article\\nin 71% of cases, and a gold article is present in the top 10 retrieved articles in 90% of cases.\\n4.5 Additional Results\\nGeneration Diversity Section 4.3 shows that RAG models are more factual and speciﬁc than\\nBART for Jeopardy question generation. Following recent work on diversity-promoting decoding\\n[33,59,39], we also investigate generation diversity by calculating the ratio of distinct ngrams to\\ntotal ngrams generated by different models. Table 5 shows that RAG-Sequence’s generations are\\nmore diverse than RAG-Token’s, and both are signiﬁcantly more diverse than BART without needing\\nany diversity-promoting decoding.\\nRetrieval Ablations A key feature of RAG is learning to retrieve relevant information for the task.\\nTo assess the effectiveness of the retrieval mechanism, we run ablations where we freeze the retriever\\nduring training. As shown in Table 6, learned retrieval improves results for all tasks.\\nWe compare RAG’s dense retriever to a word overlap-based BM25 retriever [ 53]. Here, we replace\\nRAG’s retriever with a ﬁxed BM25 system, and use BM25 retrieval scores as logits when calculating\\np(z|x). Table 6 shows the results. For FEVER, BM25 performs best, perhaps since FEVER claims are\\nheavily entity-centric and thus well-suited for word overlap-based retrieval. Differentiable retrieval\\nimproves results on all other tasks, especially for Open-Domain QA, where it is crucial.\\nIndex hot-swapping An advantage of non-parametric memory models like RAG is that knowledge\\ncan be easily updated at test time. Parametric-only models like T5 or BART need further training to\\nupdate their behavior as the world changes. To demonstrate, we build an index using the DrQA [ 5]\\nWikipedia dump from December 2016 and compare outputs from RAG using this index to the newer\\nindex from our main results (December 2018). We prepare a list of 82 world leaders who had changed\\n7'),\n",

Such tasks include open-domain question answering [ 5,29],\\nfact checking [ 56], fact completion [ 48], long-form question answering [ 12], Wikipedia article\\ngeneration [ 36], dialogue [ 41,65,9,13], translation [ 17], and language modeling [ 19,27]. Our\\nwork uniﬁes previous successes in incorporating retrieval into individual tasks, showing that a single\\nretrieval-based architecture is capable of achieving strong performance across several tasks.\\n8'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/rag.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='General-Purpose Architectures for NLP Prior work on general-purpose architectures for NLP\\ntasks has shown great success without the use of retrieval. A single, pre-trained language model\\nhas been shown to achieve strong performance on various classiﬁcation tasks in the GLUE bench-\\nmarks [ 60,61] after ﬁne-tuning [ 49,8]. GPT-2 [ 50] later showed that a single, left-to-right, pre-trained\\nlanguage model could achieve strong performance across both discriminative and generative tasks.\\nFor further improvement, BART [ 32] and T5 [ 51,52] propose a single, pre-trained encoder-decoder\\nmodel that leverages bi-directional attention to achieve stronger performance on discriminative\\nand generative tasks. Our work aims to expand the space of possible tasks with a single, uniﬁed\\narchitecture, by learning a retrieval module to augment pre-trained, generative language models.\\nLearned Retrieval There is signiﬁcant work on learning to retrieve documents in information\\nretrieval, more recently with pre-trained, neural language models [ 44,26] similar to ours. Some\\nwork optimizes the retrieval module to aid in a speciﬁc, downstream task such as question answering,\\nusing search [ 46], reinforcement learning [ 6,63,62], or a latent variable approach [ 31,20] as in our\\nwork. These successes leverage different retrieval-based architectures and optimization techniques to\\nachieve strong performance on a single task, while we show that a single retrieval-based architecture\\ncan be ﬁne-tuned for strong performance on a variety of tasks.\\nMemory-based Architectures Our document index can be seen as a large external memory for\\nneural networks to attend to, analogous to memory networks [ 64,55]. Concurrent work [ 14] learns\\nto retrieve a trained embedding for each entity in the input, rather than to retrieve raw text as in our\\nwork. Other work improves the ability of dialog models to generate factual text by attending over\\nfact embeddings [ 15,13]. A key feature of our memory is that it is comprised of raw text rather\\ndistributed representations, which makes the memory both (i) human-readable, lending a form of\\ninterpretability to our model, and (ii) human-writable, enabling us to dynamically update the model’s\\nmemory by editing the document index. This approach has also been used in knowledge-intensive\\ndialog, where generators have been conditioned on retrieved text directly, albeit obtained via TF-IDF\\nrather than end-to-end learnt retrieval [9].\\nRetrieve-and-Edit approaches Our method shares some similarities with retrieve-and-edit style\\napproaches, where a similar training input-output pair is retrieved for a given input, and then edited\\nto provide a ﬁnal output. These approaches have proved successful in a number of domains including\\nMachine Translation [ 18,22] and Semantic Parsing [ 21]. Our approach does have several differences,\\nincluding less of emphasis on lightly editing a retrieved item, but on aggregating content from several\\npieces of retrieved content, as well as learning latent retrieval, and retrieving evidence documents\\nrather than related training pairs. This said, RAG techniques may work well in these settings, and\\ncould represent promising future work.\\n6 Discussion\\nIn this work, we presented hybrid generation models with access to parametric and non-parametric\\nmemory. We showed that our RAG models obtain state of the art results on open-domain QA. We\\nfound that people prefer RAG’s generation over purely parametric BART, ﬁnding RAG more factual\\nand speciﬁc. We conducted an thorough investigation of the learned retrieval component, validating\\nits effectiveness, and we illustrated how the retrieval index can be hot-swapped to update the model\\nwithout requiring any retraining. In future work, it may be fruitful to investigate if the two components\\ncan be jointly pre-trained from scratch, either with a denoising objective similar to BART or some\\nanother objective. Our work opens up new research directions on how parametric and non-parametric\\nmemories interact and how to most effectively combine them, showing promise in being applied to a\\nwide variety of NLP tasks.\\n9'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/rag.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content='Broader Impact\\nThis work offers several positive societal beneﬁts over previous work: the fact that it is more\\nstrongly grounded in real factual knowledge (in this case Wikipedia) makes it “hallucinate” less\\nwith generations that are more factual, and offers more control and interpretability. RAG could be\\nemployed in a wide variety of scenarios with direct beneﬁt to society, for example by endowing it\\nwith a medical index and asking it open-domain questions on that topic, or by helping people be more\\neffective at their jobs.\\nWith these advantages also come potential downsides: Wikipedia, or any potential external knowledge\\nsource, will probably never be entirely factual and completely devoid of bias. Since RAG can be\\nemployed as a language model, similar concerns as for GPT-2 [ 50] are valid here, although arguably\\nto a lesser extent, including that it might be used to generate abuse, faked or misleading content in\\nthe news or on social media; to impersonate others; or to automate the production of spam/phishing\\ncontent [ 54]. Advanced language models may also lead to the automation of various jobs in the\\ncoming decades [ 16]. In order to mitigate these risks, AI systems could be employed to ﬁght against\\nmisleading content and automated spam/phishing.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThe authors would like to thank the reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive feedback on this\\npaper, as well as HuggingFace for their help in open-sourcing code to run RAG models.

We ﬁnd that doing Maximum Inner Product Search\\nwith FAISS is sufﬁciently fast on CPU, so we store document index vectors on CPU, requiring ∼100\\nGB of CPU memory for all of Wikipedia. After submission, We have ported our code to HuggingFace\\nTransformers [ 66]3, which achieves equivalent performance to the previous version but is a cleaner\\nand easier to use implementation. This version is also open-sourced. We also compress the document\\nindex using FAISS’s compression tools, reducing the CPU memory requirement to 36GB. Scripts to\\nrun experiments with RAG can be found at https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/\\nblob/master/examples/rag/README.md and an interactive demo of a RAG model can be found\\nathttps://huggingface.co/rag/\\n2https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq\\n3https://github.com/huggingface/transformers\\n17'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/rag.pdf', 'page': 17}, page_content='D Further Details on Open-Domain QA\\nFor open-domain QA, multiple answer annotations are often available for a given question. These\\nanswer annotations are exploited by extractive models during training as typically all the answer\\nannotations are used to ﬁnd matches within documents when preparing training data. For RAG, we\\nalso make use of multiple annotation examples for Natural Questions and WebQuestions by training\\nthe model with each (q,a)pair separately, leading to a small increase in accuracy. For TriviaQA,\\nthere are often many valid answers to a given question, some of which are not suitable training targets,\\nsuch as emoji or spelling variants. For TriviaQA, we ﬁlter out answer candidates if they do not occur\\nin top 1000 documents for the query.\\nCuratedTrec preprocessing The answers for CuratedTrec are given in the form of regular expres-\\nsions, which has been suggested as a reason why it is unsuitable for answer-generation models [20].\\nTo overcome this, we use a pre-processing step where we ﬁrst retrieve the top 1000 documents for\\neach query, and use the answer that most frequently matches the regex pattern as the supervision\\ntarget. If no matches are found, we resort to a simple heuristic: generate all possible permutations for\\neach regex, replacing non-deterministic symbols in the regex nested tree structure with a whitespace.\\nTriviaQA Evaluation setups The open-domain QA community customarily uses public develop-\\nment datasets as test datasets, as test data for QA datasets is often restricted and dedicated to reading\\ncompehension purposes. We report our results using the datasets splits used in DPR [ 26], which are\\nconsistent with common practice in Open-domain QA. For TriviaQA, this test dataset is the public\\nTriviaQA Web Development split. Roberts et al. [52] used the TriviaQA ofﬁcial Wikipedia test set\\ninstead. Févry et al. [14] follow this convention in order to compare with Roberts et al. [52] (See\\nappendix of [ 14]). We report results on both test sets to enable fair comparison to both approaches.\\nWe ﬁnd that our performance is much higher using the ofﬁcial Wiki test set, rather than the more\\nconventional open-domain test set, which we attribute to the ofﬁcial Wiki test set questions being\\nsimpler to answer from Wikipedia.\\nE Further Details on FEVER\\nFor FEVER classiﬁcation, we follow the practice from [ 32], and ﬁrst re-generate the claim, and\\nthen classify using the representation of the ﬁnal hidden state, before ﬁnally marginalizing across\\ndocuments to obtain the class probabilities. The FEVER task traditionally has two sub-tasks. The\\nﬁrst is to classify the claim as either \"Supported\", \"Refuted\" or \"Not Enough Info\", which is the task\\nwe explore in the main paper. FEVER’s other sub-task involves extracting sentences from Wikipedia\\nas evidence supporting the classiﬁcation prediction. As FEVER uses a different Wikipedia dump to\\nus, directly tackling this task is not straightforward. We hope to address this in future work.\\nF Null Document Probabilities\\nWe experimented with adding \"Null document\" mechanism to RAG, similar to REALM [ 20] in order\\nto model cases where no useful information could be retrieved for a given input. Here, if kdocuments\\nwere retrieved, we would additionally \"retrieve\" an empty document and predict a logit for the null\\ndocument, before marginalizing over k+ 1predictions. We explored modelling this null document\\nlogit by learning (i) a document embedding for the null document, (ii) a static learnt bias term, or\\n(iii) a neural network to predict the logit. We did not ﬁnd that these improved performance, so in\\nthe interests of simplicity, we omit them. For Open MS-MARCO, where useful retrieved documents\\ncannot always be retrieved, we observe that the model learns to always retrieve a particular set of\\ndocuments for questions that are less likely to beneﬁt from retrieval, suggesting that null document\\nmechanisms may not be necessary for RAG.\\nG Parameters\\nOur RAG models contain the trainable parameters for the BERT-base query and document encoder of\\nDPR, with 110M parameters each (although we do not train the document encoder ourselves) and\\n406M trainable parameters from BART-large, 406M parameters, making a total of 626M trainable\\n18'),\n",

The collapse could be due to a less-explicit\\nrequirement for factual knowledge in some tasks, or the longer target sequences, which could result\\nin less informative gradients for the retriever.

These\\nanswer annotations are exploited by extractive models during training as typically all the answer\\nannotations are used to ﬁnd matches within documents when preparing training data. For RAG, we\\nalso make use of multiple annotation examples for Natural Questions and WebQuestions by training\\nthe model with each (q,a)pair separately, leading to a small increase in accuracy. For TriviaQA,\\nthere are often many valid answers to a given question, some of which are not suitable training targets,\\nsuch as emoji or spelling variants. For TriviaQA, we ﬁlter out answer candidates if they do not occur\\nin top 1000 documents for the query.\\nCuratedTrec preprocessing The answers for CuratedTrec are given in the form of regular expres-\\nsions, which has been suggested as a reason why it is unsuitable for answer-generation models [20].'),\n",

If no matches are found, we resort to a simple heuristic: generate all possible permutations for\\neach regex, replacing non-deterministic symbols in the regex nested tree structure with a whitespace.\\nTriviaQA Evaluation setups The open-domain QA community customarily uses public develop-\\nment datasets as test datasets, as test data for QA datasets is often restricted and dedicated to reading\\ncompehension purposes. We report our results using the datasets splits used in DPR [ 26], which are\\nconsistent with common practice in Open-domain QA. For TriviaQA, this test dataset is the public\\nTriviaQA Web Development split. Roberts et al. [52] used the TriviaQA ofﬁcial Wikipedia test set\\ninstead. Févry et al.

The FEVER task traditionally has two sub-tasks. The\\nﬁrst is to classify the claim as either \"Supported\", \"Refuted\" or \"Not Enough Info\", which is the task\\nwe explore in the main paper.

We hope to address this in future work.\\nF Null Document Probabilities\\nWe experimented with adding \"Null document\" mechanism to RAG, similar to REALM [ 20] in order\\nto model cases where no useful information could be retrieved for a given input. Here, if kdocuments\\nwere retrieved, we would additionally \"retrieve\" an empty document and predict a logit for the null\\ndocument, before marginalizing over k+ 1predictions. We explored modelling this null document\\nlogit by learning (i) a document embedding for the null document, (ii) a static learnt bias term, or\\n(iii) a neural network to predict the logit.
